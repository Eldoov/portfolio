            <h3>Hello,</h3>
            <p>My name is Zuowen Tang, and I am a current international student studying at Boston University. I am pursuing a master’s degree in computer science, security branch.  However, I find front-end development very interesting, and HTML and CSS are the first languages I have ever learned. By far, I have written a few WordPress templates based on those two languages.</p>
            <p>I was born in China and have lived there for over 20 years. I moved to Maryland, U.S., to pursue my bachelor’s degree in Liberal Arts because I was interested in western culture and philosophy. Though I have not forgotten how much I have liked computer science since I was very young, I decided to continue my education in the industry after graduation. </p>
            <p>Now I live in Boston, MA. Not very far from the university (though, in Boston, you are never far away from a university.) I live with my lovely boyfriend, who’s studying for a Master’s degree in Law. The picture on the left of this page was me eating a slice of watermelon while we visited Virginia last summer. </p>
